                    This section's a bit of a work in progress. I'm thinking I'll use it to upload some little tid-bits (mostly
                    physical derivations) I find interesting. Some ideas include:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i>Parametric excitation and the physics of swings.</i> I think the physics of pumping on a swing (or
                        of parametric excitation/instability more generally) is really interesting. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>Spinors.</i> Spinors are kind of wild. The quantization of angular momentum makes perfect
                        sense when described in terms of spherical harmonics, and the somewhat confusing notion of 
                        "intrinsic angular momentum" becomes a lot clearer once the Wigner-Eckart theorem has been introduced. 
                        Neither of these, however, make spinors any less confusing&mdash;no spherical harmonic could ever
                        lead to angular momentum $\hbar/2$, and what on earth is a rank-$1/2$ tensor? I came across an argument
                        in Andr&eacute; Mercier's textbook <i>Analyatical and Canonical Formalism in Physics</i> showing rank-$1/2$ tensors are, 
                        in fact, a natural part of any space with "isotropic vectors" (non-zero vectors with zero norm). Since
                        Minkowski space has isotropic vectors (anything on the light cone),
                        spinors must exist. I think it'd be a fun exercise to work through this argument (which is originally
                        due to Marcel Riesz). As far as I can tell, this is not common knowledge in the physics world.
