                    It is notoriously difficult to describe the behavior of many interacting particles with quantum mechanics, 
                    since the number of possible system configurations grows exponentially with the number of particles. Often, 
                    to make any progress, one has to approximate. Much artistry goes into crafting these approximations. The 
                    physicist has to balance tractability (a model that no one can work with is hardly useful) and predictive 
                    power (sure, the calculations would be trivially easy if you assume that nothing in your system does anything, 
                    but what does that get you?). And the best models are more than just tractable and powerful; they provide deep, 
                    intuitive physical insights into the system of interest. Here, I want to present a model that checks all three 
                    of these boxes: the Gross-Pitaevskii model.

                <h3>I. The Gross-Pitaevskii model.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to describe a dilute gas of interacting bosons. In the language of second-quantization with 
                    2-body interactions, we can describe the system with a Schr&ouml;dinger field $\Psi(\mathbf r, t)$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        H = \int d^3r\left(\Psi^\dagger(\mathbf r, t)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2M}+V(\mathbf r)\right)\Psi(\mathbf r, t) + \frac{1}{2}\int d^3r'\Psi^\dagger(\mathbf r', t)\Psi^\dagger(\mathbf r, t)U(\mathbf r-\mathbf r')\Psi(\mathbf r', t)\Psi(\mathbf r, t)\right),
                    \end{equation}
                    where $M$ is the single particle mass, $V(\mathbf r)$ is some external potential and 
                    $U(\mathbf r-\mathbf r')$ is the interaction potential. The key assumption in the Gross-Pitaevskii model is 
                    that the gas is dilute; i.e., particles are on average far enough apart that the short-range behavior of 
                    $U$ doesn't matter. Mathematically, we assume $\Psi$ varies with on a scale much greater than $U$, and we 
                    can therefore pull the $\Psi$ terms out from under the $\mathbf r'$ integral:
                    \begin{equation}
                        H = \int d^3r\left(\Psi^\dagger(\mathbf r, t)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2M}+V(\mathbf r)\right)\Psi(\mathbf r, t) +\frac{g}{2}\Psi^\dagger(\mathbf r, t)\Psi^\dagger(\mathbf r, t)\Psi(\mathbf r, t)\Psi(\mathbf r, t)\right)
                    \end{equation}
                    Where $g = \int d^3r'U(r')$. The field-momentum conjugate to $\Psi(\mathbf r, t)$ is $i\Psi^\dagger(\mathbf r, t)$, 
                    so we can write the Heisenberg equation of motion for $\Psi$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        i\hbar \frac{d\Psi(\mathbf r, t)}{dt} = [\Psi(\mathbf r, t),H] = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2M}+V(\mathbf r)+ g\Psi^\dagger (\mathbf r, t)\Psi(\mathbf r, t)\right)\Psi(\mathbf r, t).
                        \label{GPE}
                    \end{equation}
                </p><p>    
                    This is the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. As presented here, the GP equation is an operator equation for $\Psi$. 
                    In many cases, though, we would like (for simulation purposes) to treat $\Psi$ as if it were a c-number. 
                    Technically, this means we assume most of the the particles are in the same state $\ket{\psi}$. Then we can take the expectation value 
                    $\psi(\mathbf r,t) = \bra{\psi}\Psi(\mathbf r,t)\ket{\psi}$ to get:
                    \begin{equation}
                        i\hbar \frac{d\psi}{dt} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla^2}{2M}+V+gn|\psi|^2\right)\psi,
                    \end{equation}
                    Where operator product in the last term simplifies because the matrix elements $\bra{\phi}\Psi\ket{\psi}$ 
                    (for $\ket{\phi}$ some other state) are negligible. This equation admits an intuitive physical 
                    interpretation: when all the atoms are in the same state, they share a single 'condensate wave function' which follows the 
                    normal Schr&ouml;dinger equation with the addition of a repulsive potential proportional to the condensate density at each point.
                </p><br><p>
                    There are many other ways to derive the GP equation (see Svistunov, Babaev, and Prokof'ev; Pethick and Smith; 
                    or Wikipedia). This is the derivation originally given by Pitaevskii, and I think it remains the most intuitive. 
                    The GP equation is mathematically identical to equations that arise in several other fields, such as the Ginzburg-Landau 
                    equation for the superconducting order parameter, the Manakov system equations in fiber optics, and as the low-energy 
                    limit of a scalar $\phi^4$ theory with $U(1)$ symmetry in relativistic field theory. This universality arises because 
                    of its simplicity: it's the lowest-order correction to a $U(1)-$invariant field theory with local interactions. My choice 
                    to call it the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is simply a result of my background in atomic physics.
